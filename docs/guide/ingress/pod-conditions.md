# Using pod conditions / pod readiness gates

One can add so-called [»Pod readiness gates«](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-lifecycle/#pod-readiness-gate) to Kubernetes pods. A readiness gate can be used by e.g. a controller to mark a pod as ready or as unready by setting a custom condition on the pod.

The AWS ALB ingress controller can set such a condition on your pods. This is needed under certain circumstances to achieve full zero downtime rolling deployments. Consider the following example:
* low number of replicas in a deployment (e.g. one to three)
* start a rolling update of the deployment
* rollout of new pods takes less time than it takes the ALB ingress controller to register the new pods and for their health state turn »Healthy« in the target group
* at some point during this rolling update, the target group might only have registered targets that are in »Initial« or »Draining« state; this results in service outage

In order to avoid this situation, the AWS ALB ingress controller can set the before mentioned condition on the pods that constitute your ingress backend services. The condition status on a pod will only be set to `True` when the corresponding target in the ALB target group shows a health state of »Healthy«. This prevents the rolling update of a deployment from terminating old pods until the newly created pods are »Healthy« in the ALB target group and ready to take traffic.


## Pod configuration

Add a readiness gate with `conditionType: target-health.alb.ingress.k8s.aws/<ingress name>_<service port>` to your pod. The Ingress and Service names should be the same.

Example:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: nginx-service
spec:
  clusterIP: None
  ports:
  - port: 80
    protocol: TCP
    targetPort: 80
  selector:
    app: nginx
---
apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: nginx-ingress
  annotations:
    kubernetes.io/ingress.class: alb
    alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/target-type: ip
    alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/scheme: internal
spec:
  rules:
    - http:
        paths:
          - backend:
              serviceName: nginx-service
              servicePort: 80
            path: /*
---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: nginx-deployment
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  replicas: 2
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      readinessGates:
      - conditionType: target-health.alb.ingress.k8s.aws/nginx-ingress_80
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
```

If your pod is part of multiple ingresses / target groups and you want to make sure your pod is `Healthy` in all of them before it is marked as `Ready`, add one `readinessGate` per ingress.


## Checking the pod condition status

The status of the readiness gates can be verified with `kubectl get pod -o wide`:
```
NAME                          READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE   IP         NODE                       READINESS GATES
nginx-test-5744b9ff84-7ftl9   1/1     Running   0          81s   10.1.2.3   ip-10-1-2-3.ec2.internal   0/1
```

When the target is registered and healthy in the ALB, the output will look like:
```
NAME                          READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE   IP         NODE                       READINESS GATES
nginx-test-5744b9ff84-7ftl9   1/1     Running   0          81s   10.1.2.3   ip-10-1-2-3.ec2.internal   1/1
```

If a readiness gate doesn't get ready, you can check the reason via:

```console
$ kubectl get pod nginx-test-5744b9ff84-7ftl9 -o yaml | grep -B5 'type: target-health'
    - lastProbeTime: "2020-02-28T10:05:08Z"
      lastTransitionTime: "2020-02-28T10:05:08Z"
      message: Target registration is in progress.
      reason: Elb.RegistrationInProgress
      status: "False"
      type: target-health.alb.ingress.k8s.aws/nginx-test_80
```
